0,he,him,"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?"
1,he,him,You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.
2,he,him,Poor devil!
3,he,him,What are you up to now?
4,Unknown,Unknown,"Looking for lodgings,"
5,Unknown,Unknown,Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.
6,he,him,"That's a strange thing,"
7,he,him,you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.
8,Unknown,Unknown,And who was the first?
9,he,Unknown,"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse."
10,he,Unknown,By Jove!
11,his,his,"if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone."
12,his,his,"You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,"
13,him,his,perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.
14,him,his,"Why, what is there against him?"
15,his,his,"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough."
16,Unknown,his,"A medical student, I suppose?"
17,his,his,"No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors."
18,his,his,Did you never ask him what he was going in for?
19,his,his,"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."
20,his,his,"I should like to meet him,"
21,his,his,"If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?"
22,his,his,"He is sure to be at the laboratory,"
23,his,his,"He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon."
24,his,his,"Certainly,"
25,Unknown,him,"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,"
26,Unknown,him,"I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible."
27,him,him,"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,"
28,him,him,"It seems to me, Stamford,"
29,him,him,"that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it."
30,him,he,"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,"
31,him,him,"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge."
32,him,him,Very right too.
33,him,him,"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape."
34,him,him,Beating the subjects!
35,Unknown,him,"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes."
36,him,him,And yet you say he is not a medical student?
37,Unknown,him,"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him."
38,his,his,"I've found it! I've found it,"
39,his,his,"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else."
40,his,his,"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"
41,his,his,How are you?
42,his,his,"You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive."
43,his,his,How on earth did you know that?
44,his,his,"Never mind,"
45,Unknown,his,The question now is about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?
46,Unknown,his,"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,"
47,Unknown,his,but practically--
48,Unknown,his,"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!"
49,Unknown,his,"Let us have some fresh blood,"
50,his,his,"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction."
51,Unknown,his,Ha! ha!
52,his,his,What do you think of that?
53,his,his,"It seems to be a very delicate test,"
54,his,his,"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."
55,his,his,Indeed!
56,his,his,"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty."
57,his,his,"You are to be congratulated,"
58,his,his,"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive."
59,his,his,"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,"
60,his,his,You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police News of the Past.'
61,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,"
62,Lefevre,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I have to be careful,"
63,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,for I dabble with poisons a good deal.
64,his,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"We came here on business,"
65,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together."
66,Lefevre,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,"
67,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"which would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?"
68,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,"
69,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?"
70,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,By no means.
71,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together."
72,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I keep a bull pup,"
73,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present."
74,Unknown,his,Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?
75,Unknown,his,"It depends on the player,"
76,Unknown,his,A well-played violin is a treat for the gods--a badly-played one--
77,Unknown,his,"Oh, that's all right,"
78,Unknown,his,"I think we may consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you."
79,Unknown,his,When shall we see them?
80,Unknown,his,"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle everything,"
81,his,his,"All right--noon exactly,"
82,his,Unknown,"By the way,"
83,his,Unknown,how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?
84,Unknown,his,"That's just his little peculiarity,"
85,him,his,A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.
86,him,Unknown,Oh! a mystery is it?
87,him,Unknown,"This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study of mankind is man,' you know."
88,Unknown,Unknown,"You must study him, then,"
89,Unknown,Unknown,"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Good-bye."
90,him,Unknown,"Good-bye,"
