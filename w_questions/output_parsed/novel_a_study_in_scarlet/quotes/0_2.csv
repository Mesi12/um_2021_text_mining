0,Unknown,his,"You appear to be astonished,"
1,Unknown,his,Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.
2,Unknown,Unknown,To forget it!
3,Unknown,his,"You see,"
4,Unknown,his,"I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."
5,Unknown,his,But the Solar System!
6,Unknown,him,What the deuce is it to me?
7,his,him,you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.
8,his,Unknown,"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,"
9,his,Unknown,I may as well give up the attempt at once.
10,Unknown,his,"I have to use this room as a place of business,"
11,him,his,and these people are my clients.
12,his,his,"The Book of Life,"
13,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"From a drop of water,"
14,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable."
15,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,What ineffable twaddle!
16,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,I never read such rubbish in my life.
17,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,What is it?
18,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Why, this article,"
19,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him."
20,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"You would lose your money,"
21,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,As for the article I wrote it myself.
22,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,You!
23,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese."
24,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,And how?
25,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here."
26,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,And these other people?
27,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee."
28,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"But do you mean to say,"
29,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?"
30,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan."
31,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"You were told, no doubt."
32,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished."
33,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"It is simple enough as you explain it,"
34,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.
35,his,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,"
36,Lecoq,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine."
37,Lecoq,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Have you read Gaboriau's works?
38,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?
39,his,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Lecoq was a miserable bungler,"
40,Unknown,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid."
41,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"This fellow may be very clever,"
42,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,but he is certainly very conceited.
43,Unknown,he,"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,"
44,his,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"What is the use of having brains in our profession? I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villany with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it."
45,his,Unknown,I wonder what that fellow is looking for?
46,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,"
47,his,Unknown,Brag and bounce!
48,his,Unknown,He knows that I cannot verify his guess.
49,his,him,"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"
50,Unknown,Unknown,"May I ask, my lad,"
51,Unknown,Unknown,what your trade may be?
52,Unknown,him,"Commissionaire, sir,"
53,Unknown,him,Uniform away for repairs.
54,Unknown,Unknown,And you were?
55,Unknown,him,"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir."
