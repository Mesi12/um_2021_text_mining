0,him,Jefferson Hope,"Brother Ferrier,"
1,his,Jefferson Hope,"the true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?"
2,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"It is so,"
3,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected."
4,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,And how have I neglected it?
5,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not--?
6,Young,Young,Where are your wives?
7,Young,Young,"Call them in, that I may greet them."
8,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"It is true that I have not married,"
9,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants."
10,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,"
11,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land."
12,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? 'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.' This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it."
13,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers*1, but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that?"
14,her,Jefferson Hope,"You will give us time,"
15,Unknown,Jefferson Hope,My daughter is very young--she is scarce of an age to marry.
16,Young,Young,"She shall have a month to choose,"
17,her,Jefferson Hope,At the end of that time she shall give her answer.
18,Unknown,Jefferson Hope,"It were better for you, John Ferrier,"
19,her,Jefferson Hope,"that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!"
20,Unknown,Jefferson Hope,"I could not help it,"
21,his,Jefferson Hope,"His voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?"
22,His,Jefferson Hope,"Don't you scare yourself,"
23,her,Jefferson Hope,"We'll fix it up somehow or another. You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap, do you?"
24,Lucy,Lucy,"No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. He's a likely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs."
25,Lucy,Lucy,"When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them."
26,Lucy,Lucy,"But we haven't opposed him yet,"
27,Lucy,Lucy,"It will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah."
28,Lucy,Lucy,Leave Utah!
29,Lucy,Lucy,That's about the size of it.
30,Lucy,Lucy,But the farm?
31,Lucy,Lucy,"We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. I don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to me. Guess I'm too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction."
32,Lucy,Lucy,"But they won't let us leave,"
33,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. In the meantime, don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes swelled up, else he'll be walking into me when he sees you. There's nothing to be afeared about, and there's no danger at all."
