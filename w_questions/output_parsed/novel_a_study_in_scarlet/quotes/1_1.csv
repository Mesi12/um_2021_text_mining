0,Unknown,His,"Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,"
1,his,His,You've hurt me!
2,his,Unknown,"Have I though,"
3,his,Unknown,I didn't go for to do it.
4,her,His,How is it now?
5,her,His,"Kiss it and make it well,"
6,him,His,That's what mother used to do. Where's mother?
7,him,His,Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.
8,her,His,"Gone, eh!"
9,her,His,"Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and now she's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?"
10,her,His,"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie. What's that you've got?"
11,her,His,Pretty things! fine things!
12,her,His,When we goes back to home I'll give them to brother Bob.
13,her,His,"You'll see prettier things than them soon,"
14,her,His,You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember when we left the river?
15,her,His,"Oh, yes."
16,her,His,"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But there was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and--and--"
17,her,His,"And you couldn't wash yourself,"
18,her,His,"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother."
19,her,His,"Then mother's a deader too,"
20,her,His,"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!"
21,her,His,Do you mean that we are going to die too?
22,her,her,I guess that's about the size of it.
23,her,her,Why didn't you say so before?
24,her,her,"You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again."
25,her,her,"Yes, you will, dearie."
26,her,her,"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long will it be first?"
27,her,her,I don't know--not very long.
28,her,her,"Cocks and hens,"
29,her,her,"Say, did God make this country?"
30,her,her,"Of course He did,"
31,her,her,"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,"
32,Unknown,her,I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.
33,Unknown,her,What would ye think of offering up prayer?
34,Unknown,her,"It ain't night yet,"
35,Unknown,her,"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains."
36,Unknown,her,Why don't you say some yourself?
37,Unknown,His,"I disremember them,"
38,Unknown,His,"I hain't said none since I was half the height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out, and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses."
39,Unknown,she,"Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,"
40,his,she,You've got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind o' good.
41,his,Unknown,"The wells are to the right, my brothers,"
42,his,Unknown,"To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,"
43,his,Unknown,"Fear not for water,"
44,his,Unknown,He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.
45,his,Unknown,Amen! Amen!
46,his,Unknown,Redskins
47,his,Unknown,"There can't be any number of Injuns here,"
48,his,Unknown,"We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains."
49,his,Unknown,"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,"
50,his,Unknown,"And I,"
51,his,Unknown,"and I,"
52,His,Unknown,"Leave your horses below and we will await you here,"
53,His,His,"This is what they call delirium, I guess,"
54,His,his,"My name is John Ferrier,"
55,His,his,me and that little un are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south.
56,His,his,Is she your child?
57,Unknown,his,"I guess she is now,"
58,Unknown,his,"she's mine 'cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?"
59,His,his,there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.
60,His,his,"Nigh upon ten thousand,"
61,His,his,we are the persecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.
62,his,his,"I never heard tell on him,"
63,his,his,He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.
64,John Ferrier,his,"Do not jest at that which is sacred,"
65,John Ferrier,his,"We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert."
66,his,John Ferrier,"I see,"
67,John Ferrier,John Ferrier,you are the Mormons.
68,John Ferrier,John Ferrier,"We are the Mormons,"
69,John Ferrier,John Ferrier,And where are you going?
70,John Ferrier,John Ferrier,We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.
71,Unknown,him,"If we take you with us,"
72,his,him,it can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?
73,Ferrier,John Ferrier,"Guess I'll come with you on any terms,"
74,his,his,"Take him, Brother Stangerson,"
75,his,his,"give him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!"
76,him,his,"On, on to Zion!"
77,his,his,"You shall remain here,"
78,Unknown,his,"In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and forever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God."
