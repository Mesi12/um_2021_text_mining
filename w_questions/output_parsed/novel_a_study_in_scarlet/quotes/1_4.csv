0,Unknown,Jefferson Hope,"Maybe you don't know us,"
1,Unknown,Jefferson Hope,"This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold."
2,His,Unknown,"As He will all the nations in His own good time,"
3,His,Unknown,He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.
4,his,Jefferson Hope,"We have come,"
5,his,Jefferson Hope,"at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one."
6,his,Jefferson Hope,"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,"
7,his,Jefferson Hope,"the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man."
8,his,Jefferson Hope,"But my prospects are better,"
9,his,Jefferson Hope,"When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church."
10,his,Jefferson Hope,"It will be for the maiden to decide,"
11,his,Jefferson Hope,We will leave it all to her decision.
12,his,Jefferson Hope,"Look here,"
13,his,Jefferson Hope,"when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your faces again."
14,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"There are two ways out of the room,"
15,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?"
16,his,Jefferson Hope,"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,"
17,Stangerson,Stangerson,You shall smart for this!
18,Stangerson,Stangerson,You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days.
19,Stangerson,Unknown,"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,"
20,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,He will arise and smite you!
21,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"Then I'll start the smiting,"
22,his,Jefferson Hope,The young canting rascals!
23,his,Jefferson Hope,"I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them."
24,his,Lucy,"And so should I, father,"
25,Unknown,Lucy,but Jefferson will soon be here.
26,his,Unknown,"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be."
27,his,Unknown,"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then--"
28,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,Good God!
29,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,How you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that.
30,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"Give me food,"
31,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.
32,his,Jefferson Hope,Does Lucy bear up well?
33,his,Jefferson Hope,"Yes. She does not know the danger,"
34,John Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter."
35,Unknown,Jefferson Hope,"You're a man to be proud of,"
36,Lucy,Jefferson Hope,There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.
37,his,Unknown,"You've hit it there, pard,"
38,his,Unknown,"I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the Hope family in Utah."
39,her,Unknown,What are we to do?
40,Lucy,Unknown,"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?"
41,his,Unknown,"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes."
42,Lucy,Unknown,That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house.
43,Jefferson Hope,Jefferson Hope,"We must make our start at once,"
44,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains."
45,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"What if we are stopped,"
46,his,Jefferson Hope,"If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,"
47,his,Unknown,"To-morrow at midnight,"
48,his,Unknown,When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.
49,his,Unknown,"It is well,"
50,his,Unknown,Shall I tell Brother Drebber?
51,his,Unknown,"Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!"
52,his,Unknown,Seven to five!
53,his,Jefferson Hope,Hurry on! hurry on!
54,his,Jefferson Hope,We are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!
55,him,him,Who goes there?
56,Jefferson Hope,Jefferson Hope,"Travellers for Nevada,"
57,his,his,By whose permission?
58,Ferrier,Jefferson Hope,"The Holy Four,"
59,his,his,"Nine from seven,"
60,Jefferson Hope,Unknown,"Seven from five,"
61,his,his,"Pass, and the Lord go with you,"
