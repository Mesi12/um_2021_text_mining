0,Malthus,Unknown,"Brixton Mystery,"
1,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score."
2,Holmes,Unknown,That depends on how it turns out.
3,Holmes,Unknown,"Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be on account of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be in spite of their exertions. It's heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers. 'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire.'"
4,Unknown,Unknown,What on earth is this?
5,Holmes,Holmes,"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force,"
6,Holmes,Holmes,'Tention!
7,Holmes,Holmes,"In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?"
8,Holmes,Holmes,"No, sir, we hain't,"
9,Holmes,his,I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your wages.
10,Unknown,his,"Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time."
11,Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,"
12,Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation."
13,Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?
14,Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!"
15,Unknown,he,"My dear fellow,"
16,Holmes,he,congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.
17,Holmes,he,Do you mean that you are on the right track?
18,Holmes,he,"The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key."
19,his,he,And his name is?
20,Gregson,Tobias Gregson,"Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's navy,"
21,his,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,"
22,his,Unknown,We are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?
23,his,Unknown,"I don't mind if I do,"
24,Holmes,Holmes,"The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers."
25,Holmes,Holmes,"You do me too much honour,"
26,Holmes,Holmes,Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result.
27,his,his,"The fun of it is,"
28,Gregson,his,"that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time."
29,Tobias Gregson,his,And how did you get your clue?
30,his,his,"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson's way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?"
31,Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Yes,"
32,Gregson,Tobias Gregson,"by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road."
33,his,Tobias Gregson,"I had no idea that you noticed that,"
34,Underwood,Tobias Gregson,Have you been there?
35,his,Tobias Gregson,No.
36,Gregson,Gregson,Ha!
37,Gregson,Gregson,"you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem."
38,Holmes,Holmes,"To a great mind, nothing is little,"
39,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier's Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address."
40,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,Smart--very smart!
41,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I next called upon Madame Charpentier,"
42,Sherlock Holmes,Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, too--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn't escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your nerves. 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.

""The mother nodded. She didn't seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.

""'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I asked.

""'At eight o'clock,' she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her agitation. 'His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.'

""'And was that the last which you saw of him?'

""A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out the single word 'Yes'--and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone.

""There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice.

""'No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,' she said. 'Let us be frank with this gentleman. We did see Mr. Drebber again.'

""'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'

""'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered firmly.

""'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.'

""'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to me, 'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'

""'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered. 'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'

""'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and her daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.'

""'It is your wisest course,' said I.

""'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a ""Copenhagen"
43,his,Mr. Drebber,"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.'

""Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said. 'But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.'

""'Well?'

""'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. ""You are of age,"
44,Poor Alice,Mr. Drebber,"and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess."
45,her,Arthur,"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again,"
46,Unknown,Arthur,I will just go after him and see what he does with himself.
47,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake."
48,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"It's quite exciting,"
49,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,What happened next?
50,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,"
51,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.

""'I do not know,' she answered.

""'Not know?'

""'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'

""'After you went to bed?'

""'Yes.'

""'When did you go to bed?'

""'About eleven.'

""'So your son was gone at least two hours?'

""'Yes.'

""'Possibly four or five?'

""'Yes.'

""'What was he doing during that time?'

""'I do not know,' she answered, turning white to her very lips.

""Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,' he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect."
52,Holmes,Holmes,"Very,"
53,Holmes,Holmes,He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.
54,Holmes,Holmes,"What is your theory, then?"
55,Holmes,Holmes,"Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent."
56,Holmes,Holmes,Well done!
57,Holmes,Holmes,"Really, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet."
58,Holmes,Holmes,"I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,"
59,Holmes,Holmes,"The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won't make much of--Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!"
60,his,his,"This is a most extraordinary case,"
61,Mr. Joseph Stangerson,his,a most incomprehensible affair.
62,Gregson,Gregson,"Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!"
63,Lestrade,Mr. Lestrade,"I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?"
64,Lestrade,Mr. Lestrade,"The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,"
65,Lestrade,Mr. Lestrade,was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning.
