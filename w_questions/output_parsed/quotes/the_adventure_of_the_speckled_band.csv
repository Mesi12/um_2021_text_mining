0,him,Sherlock Holmes,"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,"
1,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,"but it's the common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."
2,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,"What is it, then--a fire?"
3,his,Sherlock Holmes,"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."
4,him,Sherlock Holmes,"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
5,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Good-morning, madam,"
6,Holmes,her,"My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
7,Sherlock Holmes,her,"It is not cold which makes me shiver,"
8,her,her,"What, then?"
9,Holmes,her,"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror."
10,her,Sherlock Holmes,"You must not fear,"
11,her,he,"We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
12,her,he,"You know me, then?"
13,her,he,"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."
14,her,he,"There is no mystery, my dear madam,"
15,Unknown,he,"The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
16,Unknown,she,"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,"
17,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."
18,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,"Farintosh,"
19,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."
20,Watson,Sherlock Holmes,Alas!
21,Watson,Sherlock Holmes,"the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."
22,his,Sherlock Holmes,"I am all attention, madam."
23,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."
24,Watson,Sherlock Holmes,"The name is familiar to me,"
25,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.

""When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than £1000 a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

""But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

""Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.

""You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."
26,her,Sherlock Holmes,"Your sister is dead, then?"
27,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
28,her,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Pray be precise as to details,"
29,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
30,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,Perfectly so.
31,her,Miss Honoria Westphail,"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.

""'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'

""'Never,' said I.

""'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'

""'Certainly not. But why?'

""'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'

""'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'

""'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'

""'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'

""'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."
32,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Indeed,"
33,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?
34,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Always.
35,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,And why?
36,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.
37,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.
38,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
39,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"One moment,"
40,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound? Could you swear to it?
41,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."
42,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Was your sister dressed?
43,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
44,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the coroner come to?
45,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
46,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,How about poison?
47,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
48,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
49,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
50,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?
51,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Yes, there are nearly always some there."
52,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"
53,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."
54,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"These are very deep waters,"
55,Armitage,Miss Honoria Westphail,pray go on with your narrative.
56,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."
57,Armitage,Miss Honoria Westphail,"You have done wisely,"
58,Armitage,Miss Honoria Westphail,But have you told me all?
59,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Yes, all."
60,Armitage,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
61,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Why, what do you mean?"
62,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"You have been cruelly used,"
63,her,her,"He is a hard man,"
64,his,her,and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.
65,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"This is a very deep business,"
66,Unknown,Miss Honoria Westphail,"There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"
67,Watson,Miss Honoria Westphail,"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."
68,her,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
69,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,By no means.
70,her,Miss Honoria Westphail,Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?
71,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."
72,her,Miss Helen Stoner,And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?
73,her,Miss Helen Stoner,"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon."
74,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"And what do you think of it all, Watson?"
75,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.
76,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Dark enough and sinister enough.
77,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."
78,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
79,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,I cannot think.
80,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."
81,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
82,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,I cannot imagine.
83,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,I see many objections to any such theory.
84,Sherlock Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!"
85,his,Unknown,Which of you is Holmes?
86,Holmes,Unknown,"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,"
87,Holmes,Unknown,"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
88,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Indeed, Doctor,"
89,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Pray take a seat.
90,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?
91,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"It is a little cold for the time of the year,"
92,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,What has she been saying to you?
93,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,"
94,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Ha! You put me off, do you?"
95,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"I know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
96,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Holmes, the busybody!"
97,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
98,Holmes,he,"Your conversation is most entertaining,"
99,her,he,"When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."
100,Unknown,his,I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.
101,Holmes,his,"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,"
102,Holmes,Holmes,"He seems a very amiable person,"
103,Holmes,Holmes,"I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own."
104,Holmes,Holmes,"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."
105,his,Miss Honoria Westphail,"I have seen the will of the deceased wife,"
106,his,Unknown,"To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of £1100, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. Each daughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."
107,Unknown,his,Look there!
108,Unknown,he,Stoke Moran?
109,Holmes,Unknown,"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,"
110,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"There is some building going on there,"
111,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,that is where we are going.
112,Holmes,Holmes,"There's the village,"
113,Holmes,Holmes,"but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is walking."
114,Holmes,Holmes,"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,"
115,Holmes,Holmes,"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
116,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"I thought it as well,"
117,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as our word."
118,Holmes,her,"I have been waiting so eagerly for you,"
119,Miss Helen Stoner,her,"All has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."
120,Holmes,Holmes,"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
121,Miss Helen Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,Good heavens!
122,Miss Helen Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,"he has followed me, then."
123,Unknown,Unknown,So it appears.
124,Miss Helen Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?
125,Miss Helen Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."
126,Miss Stoner,Unknown,"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
127,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.
128,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."
129,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room.
130,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows in it, of course?"
131,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."
132,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
133,Unknown,his,Hum!
134,Miss Honoria Westphail,his,"my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."
135,Miss Honoria Westphail,Miss Honoria Westphail,Where does that bell communicate with?
136,her,Unknown,It goes to the housekeeper's room.
137,Miss Honoria Westphail,Miss Honoria Westphail,It looks newer than the other things?
138,her,Unknown,"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
139,Miss Honoria Westphail,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
140,Unknown,his,"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."
141,her,his,"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor."
142,his,his,"Why, it's a dummy,"
143,Holmes,Unknown,Won't it ring?
144,Holmes,Holmes,"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."
145,Holmes,Holmes,How very absurd! I never noticed that before.
146,Holmes,Holmes,Very strange!
147,Holmes,Holmes,"There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"
148,Holmes,Holmes,"That is also quite modern,"
149,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,Done about the same time as the bell-rope?
150,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."
151,Holmes,Miss Honoria Westphail,"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."
152,he,he,What's in here?
153,Unknown,Unknown,My stepfather's business papers.
154,Unknown,he,"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
155,Unknown,he,"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers."
156,Unknown,he,"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
157,Unknown,he,No. What a strange idea!
158,Unknown,he,"Well, look at this!"
159,Unknown,he,No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.
160,Unknown,he,"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine."
161,Unknown,his,"Thank you. That is quite settled,"
162,his,his,Hullo! Here is something interesting!
163,his,his,"What do you make of that, Watson?"
164,Watson,Watson,It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be tied.
165,Watson,Watson,"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
166,his,his,"It is very essential, Miss Stoner,"
167,him,his,that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect.
168,Miss Stoner,Miss Helen Stoner,I shall most certainly do so.
169,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance.
170,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,I assure you that I am in your hands.
171,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."
172,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village inn over there?"
173,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"Yes, that is the Crown."
174,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?
175,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,Certainly.
176,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
177,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"Oh, yes, easily."
178,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,The rest you will leave in our hands.
179,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,But what will you do?
180,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
181,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"
182,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,Perhaps I have.
183,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."
184,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.
185,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."
186,Miss Stoner,Miss Stoner,"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."
187,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Do you know, Watson,"
188,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element of danger.
189,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Can I be of assistance?
190,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Your presence might be invaluable.
191,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Then I shall certainly come.
192,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,It is very kind of you.
193,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me.
194,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw all that I did."
195,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
196,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"You saw the ventilator, too?"
197,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."
198,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran.
199,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,My dear Holmes!
200,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
201,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,But what harm can there be in that?
202,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
203,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I cannot as yet see any connection.
204,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?
205,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,No.
206,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?
207,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I cannot say that I have.
208,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
209,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Holmes,"
210,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.
211,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."
212,Holmes,Holmes,"That is our signal,"
213,Holmes,Holmes,it comes from the middle window.
214,His,Unknown,My God!
215,His,Unknown,did you see it?
216,his,Sherlock Holmes,"It is a nice household,"
217,His,Unknown,That is the baboon.
218,Unknown,his,The least sound would be fatal to our plans.
219,Holmes,his,We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.
220,Holmes,Unknown,"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."
221,his,Sherlock Holmes,"You see it, Watson?"
222,his,Unknown,You see it?
223,his,Unknown,What can it mean?
224,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"It means that it is all over,"
225,Holmes,Unknown,"And perhaps, after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."
226,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,The band! the speckled band!
227,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,It is a swamp adder!
228,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"the deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."
229,her,he,"I had,"
230,Grimesby Roylott,he,"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.

""I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."
231,his,he,With the result of driving it through the ventilator.
232,her,he,"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
