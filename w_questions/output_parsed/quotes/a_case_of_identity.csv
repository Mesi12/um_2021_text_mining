0,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"My dear fellow,"
1,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."
2,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"And yet I am not convinced of it,"
3,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."
4,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,"
5,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
6,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,I can quite understand your thinking so.
7,Holmes,Unknown,"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"
8,Holmes,Unknown,"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."
9,Holmes,Holmes,"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
10,his,his,"This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."
11,his,his,"Ah,"
12,his,his,I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.
13,his,his,And the ring?
14,his,his,"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."
15,his,his,And have you any on hand just now?
16,his,his,"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
17,Holmes,Holmes,"I have seen those symptoms before,"
18,Holmes,Holmes,"Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
19,her,Sherlock Holmes,"Do you not find,"
20,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?
21,Unknown,her,"I did at first,"
22,his,her,but now I know where the letters are without looking.
23,her,her,"You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes,"
24,his,her,else how could you know all that?
25,Holmes,Holmes,"Never mind,"
26,Holmes,Holmes,"it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
27,Holmes,Holmes,"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
28,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?
29,his,Miss Mary Sutherland,"Yes, I did bang out of the house,"
30,Holmes,Miss Mary Sutherland,"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."
31,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Your father,"
32,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."
33,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
34,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,And your mother is alive?
35,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
36,Unknown,Mr. Windibank,"Your own little income,"
37,Holmes,Mr. Windibank,does it come out of the business?
38,Holmes,Mr. Windibank,"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."
39,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"You interest me extremely,"
40,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60."
41,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
42,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"You have made your position very clear to me,"
43,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
44,her,she,"I met him first at the gasfitters' ball,"
45,Holmes,she,"They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
46,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I suppose,"
47,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.
48,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
49,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
50,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."
51,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,No?
52,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
53,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?
54,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."
55,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?
56,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"
57,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,What office?
58,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
59,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Where did he live, then?"
60,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,He slept on the premises.
61,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,And you don't know his address?
62,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.
63,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Where did you address your letters, then?"
64,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."
65,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"It was most suggestive,"
66,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?
67,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
68,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"
69,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."
70,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"It missed him, then?"
71,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
72,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
73,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
74,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,"
75,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."
76,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
77,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."
78,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,But you have no notion as to what it could have been?
79,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,None.
80,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,One more question. How did your mother take the matter?
81,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."
82,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,And your father? Did you tell him?
83,him,Mother,"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night."
84,Holmes,Holmes,"I shall glance into the case for you,"
85,Holmes,Holmes,"and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
86,Holmes,Holmes,Then you don't think I'll see him again?
87,Holmes,Holmes,I fear not.
88,Holmes,Holmes,Then what has happened to him?
89,Holmes,Holmes,You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.
90,him,she,"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle,"
91,Mr. Angel,she,Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.
92,him,she,Thank you. And your address?
93,him,she,"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
94,him,she,"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"
95,him,she,"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."
96,him,she,"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."
97,Unknown,she,"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
98,his,Sherlock Holmes,"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,"
99,her,Sherlock Holmes,"I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."
100,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,"
101,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."
102,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."
103,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."
104,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,It surprised me.
105,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
106,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,And what else?
107,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
108,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Missing,"
109,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
110,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"That will do,"
111,her,Sherlock Holmes,"As to the letters,"
112,Hosmer Angel,Sherlock Holmes,"they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."
113,Hosmer Angel,Sherlock Holmes,"They are typewritten,"
114,Balzac,Sherlock Holmes,"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."
115,Hosmer Angel,Sherlock Holmes,Of what?
116,Balzac,Sherlock Holmes,"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"
117,Hosmer Angel,Sherlock Holmes,I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.
118,Balzac,Sherlock Holmes,"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."
119,his,Unknown,"Well, have you solved it?"
120,Holmes,Unknown,Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.
121,Holmes,Unknown,"No, no, the mystery!"
122,Holmes,Unknown,"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
123,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"
124,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,"
125,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!
126,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,"
127,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"
128,Mr. James Windibank,Mr. James Windibank,"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
129,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"On the contrary,"
130,Mr. Windibank,Mr. Windibank,I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.
131,his,Mr. Windibank,"I am delighted to hear it,"
132,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"It is a curious thing,"
133,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
134,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,"
135,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,"
136,Mr. Windibank,Mr. Windibank,"I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
137,his,Mr. Windibank,"I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
138,his,Mr. Windibank,"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."
139,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Certainly,"
140,Mr. Windibank,Mr. Windibank,"I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
141,Mr. Windibank,Mr. Windibank,What! where?
142,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, it won't do--really it won't,"
143,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
144,him,his,"It--it's not actionable,"
145,his,his,"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
146,his,Sherlock Holmes,"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,"
147,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."
148,Mr. Hosmer Angel,Sherlock Holmes,"It was only a joke at first,"
149,her,Sherlock Holmes,We never thought that she would have been so carried away.
150,his,Sherlock Holmes,"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"
151,his,his,"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,"
152,his,his,"but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."
153,Holmes,Holmes,"The law cannot, as you say, touch you,"
154,his,he,"yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
155,Unknown,he,"it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--"
156,Holmes,Holmes,There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!
157,Holmes,Holmes,"That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."
158,Holmes,Holmes,"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,"
159,Holmes,Holmes,"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."
160,Holmes,Holmes,And how did you verify them?
161,Holmes,Holmes,"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank. Voilà tout!"
162,Holmes,Holmes,And Miss Sutherland?
163,Holmes,Holmes,"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."
