0,Holmes,Holmes,"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,"
1,Watson,Watson,I was afraid that you were engaged.
2,Holmes,Holmes,So I am. Very much so.
3,Holmes,Holmes,Then I can wait in the next room.
4,Holmes,Holmes,"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
5,Holmes,Holmes,"Try the settee,"
6,Holmes,Holmes,"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."
7,Holmes,Holmes,"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,"
8,Holmes,Holmes,"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."
9,Holmes,Holmes,A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.
10,Holmes,Holmes,"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
11,his,Unknown,"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
12,his,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?"
13,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."
14,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."
15,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
16,his,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
17,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
18,his,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
19,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Well, but China?"
20,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."
21,Mr. Jabez Wilson,he,"Well, I never!"
22,Watson,he,"I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all."
23,Holmes,Holmes,"I begin to think, Watson,"
24,Holmes,Holmes,"that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
25,Mr. Jabez Wilson,his,"Yes, I have got it now,"
26,Mr. Jabez Wilson,his,"Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
27,Watson,his,"To the Red-headed League: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
28,Watson,his,What on earth does this mean?
29,Watson,Holmes,"It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
30,Watson,Holmes,"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."
31,Watson,Holmes,"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."
32,Jabez Wilson,Jabez Wilson,"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
33,Jabez Wilson,Jabez Wilson,"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,"
34,Jabez Wilson,Jabez Wilson,"I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."
35,Sherlock Holmes,Vincent Spaulding,What is the name of this obliging youth?
36,Sherlock Holmes,Vincent Spaulding,"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
37,Sherlock Holmes,Vincent Spaulding,"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."
38,Mr. Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Oh, he has his faults, too,"
39,Mr. Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."
40,Mr. Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"He is still with you, I presume?"
41,Holmes,Mr. Holmes,"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

""The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

""'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

""'Why that?' I asks.

""'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

""'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

""'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.

""'Never.'

""'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

""'And what are they worth?' I asked.

""'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

""Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

""'Tell me all about it,' said I.

""'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'

""'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

""'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

""Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

""I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."
42,Holmes,Mr. Holmes,"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,"
43,Holmes,Mr. Holmes,Pray continue your very interesting statement.
44,Holmes,Mr. Holmes,"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

""'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

""'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

""'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

""'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

""I answered that I had not.

""His face fell immediately.

""'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

""My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

""'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

""'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

""'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

""'What would be the hours?' I asked.

""'Ten to two.'

""Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

""'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

""'Is £4 a week.'

""'And the work?'

""'Is purely nominal.'

""'What do you call purely nominal?'

""'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

""'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.

""'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

""'And the work?'

""'Is to copy out the ""Encyclopaedia Britannica."
45,Mr. Duncan Ross,He,"'Certainly,' I answered.

""'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

""Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.

""Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

""This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.

""Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."
46,Armour,He,To an end?
47,Armour,He,"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
48,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"I cannot see that there is anything very funny,"
49,his,Unknown,"If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
50,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"No, no,"
51,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"
52,Sherlock Holmes,Unknown,"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

""'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

""'What, the red-headed man?'

""'Yes.'

""'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

""'Where could I find him?'

""'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

""I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
53,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Unknown,And what did you do then?
54,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."
55,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"And you did very wisely,"
56,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
57,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Grave enough!
58,Mr. Jabez Wilson,Mr. Jabez Wilson,"Why, I have lost four pound a week."
59,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"As far as you are personally concerned,"
60,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."
61,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."
62,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"
63,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,About a month then.
64,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,How did he come?
65,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,In answer to an advertisement.
66,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Was he the only applicant?
67,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"No, I had a dozen."
68,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Why did you pick him?
69,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Because he was handy and would come cheap.
70,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"At half-wages, in fact."
71,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Yes.
72,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
73,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."
74,his,Sherlock Holmes,"I thought as much,"
75,Unknown,Sherlock Holmes,Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?
76,his,Sherlock Holmes,"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."
77,Holmes,Holmes,Hum!
78,Holmes,Holmes,He is still with you?
79,Holmes,Holmes,"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
80,Holmes,Holmes,And has your business been attended to in your absence?
81,Holmes,Holmes,"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."
82,Holmes,Holmes,"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
83,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Well, Watson,"
84,Holmes,Holmes,what do you make of it all?
85,Holmes,Holmes,"I make nothing of it,"
86,Holmes,Holmes,It is a most mysterious business.
87,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"As a rule,"
88,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."
89,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"What are you going to do, then?"
90,Holmes,his,"To smoke,"
91,Unknown,his,"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes."
92,Holmes,his,"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon,"
93,Watson,Watson,"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"
94,Watson,Watson,I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.
95,Watson,Watson,"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
96,Watson,Watson,Jabez Wilson
97,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Thank you,"
98,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.
99,Watson,Watson,"Third right, fourth left,"
100,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Smart fellow, that,"
101,Holmes,Unknown,"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."
102,Holmes,Unknown,"Evidently,"
103,Holmes,Unknown,Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.
104,Watson,Unknown,Not him.
105,Holmes,Unknown,What then?
106,Watson,Unknown,The knees of his trousers.
107,Holmes,Unknown,And what did you see?
108,Watson,Unknown,What I expected to see.
109,Holmes,Unknown,Why did you beat the pavement?
110,Watson,Unknown,"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
111,Holmes,Holmes,"Let me see,"
112,Holmes,Holmes,"I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
113,Unknown,his,"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,"
114,Unknown,Unknown,"Yes, it would be as well."
115,Unknown,his,And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.
116,Unknown,his,Why serious?
117,Unknown,his,A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.
118,Unknown,his,At what time?
119,Unknown,his,Ten will be early enough.
120,Unknown,his,I shall be at Baker Street at ten.
121,Unknown,his,"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket."
122,Unknown,Unknown,Encyclopaedia
123,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Ha! Our party is complete,"
124,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."
125,Jones,Mr. Jones,"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,"
126,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.
127,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
128,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,"
129,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."
130,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,"
131,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."
132,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I think you will find,"
133,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
134,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."
135,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."
136,Holmes,Unknown,"We are close there now,"
137,Holmes,Unknown,"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."
138,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"You are not very vulnerable from above,"
139,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"Nor from below,"
140,his,Sherlock Holmes,"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!"
141,Holmes,Holmes,I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!
142,Holmes,Holmes,"You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
143,his,Mr. Merryweather,"We have at least an hour before us,"
144,Holmes,Mr. Merryweather,"for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."
145,Holmes,Mr. Merryweather,"It is our French gold,"
146,Holmes,Mr. Merryweather,We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.
147,Holmes,Mr. Merryweather,Your French gold?
148,his,Mr. Merryweather,"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
149,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Which were very well justified,"
150,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
151,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,And sit in the dark?
152,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."
153,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"They have but one retreat,"
154,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"
155,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.
156,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.
157,him,him,"It's all clear,"
158,Sherlock Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
159,Holmes,Holmes,"It's no use, John Clay,"
160,Holmes,Holmes,You have no chance at all.
161,John Clay,John Clay,"So I see,"
162,Holmes,Unknown,"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."
163,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"There are three men waiting for him at the door,"
164,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."
165,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"And I you,"
166,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.
167,Jones,Jones,"You'll see your pal again presently,"
168,Jones,Jones,He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.
169,Jones,Jones,"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
170,Jones,Jones,"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.'"
171,Jones,Jones,"All right,"
172,Jones,Jones,"Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"
173,John Clay,Mr. John Clay,"That is better,"
174,Mr. Merryweather,Mr. Merryweather,"Really, Mr. Holmes,"
175,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.
176,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,"
177,Holmes,Sherlock Holmes,"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."
178,Mr. Holmes,Mr. John Clay,"You see, Watson,"
179,his,Unknown,"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The £4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."
180,Mr. Merryweather,Unknown,But how could you guess what the motive was?
181,Mr. Holmes,Unknown,"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

""So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."
182,Mr. Holmes,Unknown,And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?
183,His,Unknown,"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
184,Mr. Holmes,Unknown,"You reasoned it out beautifully,"
185,His,he,"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."
186,His,he,"It saved me from ennui,"
187,Unknown,he,Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.
188,Unknown,he,"And you are a benefactor of the race,"
189,his,his,"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,"
190,Unknown,he,"'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
