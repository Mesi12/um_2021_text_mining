# Validation set

- Using [tagtog.net](tagtog.net):
- our project: [https://www.tagtog.net/accordionmonkey/textmining-project/pool](https://www.tagtog.net/accordionmonkey/textmining-project/pool)

Questions:

- How should the validation dataset look like? What exactly is an annotation?

Example: "Sherlock entered the flat in Bakerstreet."

- Either
    - character: sherlock
    - location: Bakerstreet
- Or
    - character in sentence at index 0 to 7
    - location in sentence at index 29 to 39
